# ExpAcc: Explore the Accrual Landscape

This is the code repository for the paper [Bierey and Gassen (2018), Exploring the Accrual Landscape](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/rewe/research/expacc_paper.pdf).

In this early stage project, we replicate and extend the key findings of [Bushman, Lerman and Zhang (JAR, 2016): The Changing Landscape of Accrual Accounting](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12100/abstract) by investigating the role of changes in the underlying cash flow distribution across time and by verifying their and our key findings for an international sample. Please refer to the Appendix of our paper for guidance on how to reproduce our work.
