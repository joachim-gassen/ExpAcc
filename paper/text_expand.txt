This web app accompanies our study <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqxu24twffmm81v/ExpAcc_paper.pdf?dl=1">Bierey and Gassen (2018), Exploring the Accrual Landscape</a>.
<p>
In this early stage project, we replicate and extend the key findings of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12100/abstract">Bushman, Lerman and Zhang (JAR, 2016): The Changing Landscape of Accrual Accounting</a> by investigating the role of changes in the underlying cash flow distribution across time and by verifying their and our key findings for an international sample. The code necessary for reproducing our work, including this app, is available on <a href="https://www.github.com/joachim-gassen/ExpAcc">Github</a>.
<p>
Below you find a dynamic web page representing the international country-year sample that underlies our key findings. 
The sample contains yearly distributional statistics of cash flow from operations for a sample of 26 countries. 
Along with these distributional statistics, the sample includes the regression statistics of an OLS model regressing total accruals on cash flow from operations, estimated across all country years. Hover over variable names in the descriptive table with your mouse to get somewhat more detail on variable definitions.
The regression reported at the bottom of this page reflects column (3) of Table 8. All other columns of the same table can be generated by changing the dependent and indepedent variable(s). In addition, you can regenerate all regressions that underly the Figures 10 and 11.
