This web app accompanies our study <a href="https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/rewe/research/expacc_paper.pdf">Bierey and Gassen (2018), Exploring the Accrual Landscape</a>.
<p>
In this early stage project, we replicate and extend the key findings of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12100/abstract">Bushman, Lerman and Zhang (JAR, 2016): The Changing Landscape of Accrual Accounting</a> by investigating the role of changes in the underlying cash flow distribution across time and by verifying their and our key findings for an international sample. The code necessary for reproducing our work, including this app, is available on <a href="https://www.github.com/joachim-gassen/ExpAcc">Github</a>.
<p>
Below you find a dynamic web page representing the international and the U.S. country-year sample that underlie our key findings. 
The international sample contains yearly distributional statistics of cash flow from operations for a sample of 26 countries and the U.S. sample contains 51 yearly observations like the data underlying Table 4 of Bushman, Lerman and Zhang (2016). 
Along with these distributional statistics, the samples include yearly regression statistics for three different OLS models (level, change and Dechow/Dichev) regressing (change in) total accruals on (change in) cash flow from operations (including lead and lag values for the Dechow and Dichev model). Hover over variable names in the descriptive table with your mouse to get somewhat more detail on variable definitions.
The regression reported at the bottom of this page reflects column (2) of Table 8 for the international sample. All other columns of the same table can be generated by changing the dependent and indepedent variable(s). In addition, you can regenerate all regressions that underly the Figures 10 and 11.
