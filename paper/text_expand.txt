This web app accompanies the study <a href="https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/rewe/research/expacc_paper.pdf">Gassen (2018), Exploring the Accrual Landscape by Open Science</a>.
<p>
In this project, I evaluate and extend the key findings of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12100/abstract">Bushman, Lerman and Zhang (JAR, 2016): The Changing Landscape of Accrual Accounting</a> by reproducing their analysis and by exploring U.S. data as well as an international panel sample. The code necessary for reproducing my work, including this app, is available on <a href="https://www.github.com/joachim-gassen/ExpAcc">Github</a>.
<p>
Below you find a dynamic web page featuring four different samples: 
<ul>
<li>The international country-year sample as contained in the paper. This is the default sample.
<li>An international sample that also contains the U.S. data from the period 1988 - 2016.
<li>The U.S. time-series sample as contained in the paper.
<li>A U.S. time-series sample where I follow the methodology of Buschmann et al. as outlined in the notes to their Table 4 in a verbatim fashion.
</ul>
<p>
All samples contain the same set of variables:
<ul>
<li>A set of variables characterizing the cash flow distribution of the given country year. A subset of these is being used in the paper.
<li>The independent variables as used in the paper.
<li>A set of potential dependent variables for three different cash flow accrual models: 
level (univariate regression of accruals on cash flow), changes (univariate regression of change in accruals on change in cash flow) and dd (a Dechow and Dichev type regression model). The paper presents mostly the findings for the Dechow and Dichev model.
</ul>
When you hover over the variable names in the descriptive table, a tool tip will indicate variable definitions. 
I hope that the web app is mostly self-explanatory. You can subset the analysis to certain countries, if you like. Also, you can change the outlier treatment (as the data is based on annual statistics it should not be very outlier-prone but see for yourself). In an essence: Just scroll down, take a look around and select parameters in the menu bar to the left. Towards the bottom of the page you will find a "hover-able" scatter plot and a regression module that, by default, reports the results for the model contained in Column 6 of Table 9 in the paper. You should be able to reproduce any regression model contained in the paper by adjusting the sample and/or the regression parameters.
